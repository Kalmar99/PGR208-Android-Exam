## PGR208 - Android Programming

My Exam in PGR208 Android Programming at HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania

### Functionality
* Gets a list of places from the [noforeignland](https://www.noforeignland.com/) api and caches them in a SQLite db.
* Lets users view individual places and important information about each place such as: gas price, wind conditions etc

EDIT: after the exam, the api changed and viewing induvidual places doesent work anymore.
